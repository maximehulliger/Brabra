#TODO
## Scene View
- ObjectField: delete button for object (if open, on the right, a cross)
- ObjectField: add make children under their parent
- Field: SelectField (with a given map)
- Store: filter by name
- Editor / Viewer

#TODO good looking
- feedback popwindow size (smaller)
- CreationView: space between buttons
- Views: Scroll view (vertical only)
- String/Float Field (& others with a text field): smaller text field width to see the (field )name
	-> even smaller for quaternion field (we don't need to set rotation axis that often..)
	-> test: gravity in para, starship rotation 
- SceneField: buttons in the middle and spaced
- SceneField: image max size
-> then the project is over, for you :)
