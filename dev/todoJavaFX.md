#TODO
## Scene View
- ObjectField: delete button for object (if open, on the right, a cross)
- ObjectField: add make children under their parent
- ObjectField: comboBox parent
- Field: SelectField (list of with string)
- Store: filter by name
- Editor / Viewer

#TODO good looking
- CreationView: space between buttons
- Views: Scroll view (vertical only)
- ParametersView: ping button on the right
- String/Float Field (& others with a text field): smaller text field width to see the (field )name
	-> even smaller for quaternion field (we don't need to set rotation axis that often..)
	-> test: gravity in para, starship rotation 
- SceneField: buttons in the middle and spaced
- SceneField: image max size
- then the project is over :)

#Later (maybe)

<br>

#Known bugs to fix
- startup delayed..
- crash when close the javaFX window with the cross.
